Create a new password reset endpoint in the src/Skoruba.IdentityServer4.Admin.Api/Controllers/UsersController.cs that follows these specifications:
Please provide complete, production-ready code with proper error handling and comments.
Following Clean Code and SOLID principles.
First analyse the Functionality, Technical Requirements, Code Structure, Security Considerations and Sample Response.
Second note a best way to develop.
And last build the development code.


Functionality:
1. Create a POST endpoint called "ResetPassword" that accepts an email address in the request body
2. Delete the existing user from IdentityServer4 using the provided email
3. Create a new user in IdentityServer4 with the same email, credentials and Claims
4. Generate a secure random password for the new user with 1-hour expiration
5. Send an email to the user containing the generated password (placeholder for email content is acceptable)

Technical Requirements:
- Use ASP.NET Core and IdentityServer4 APIs
- Implement proper input validation for the email address
- Use cryptographically secure random generation for the password
- Implement password hashing before storage
- Set up proper dependency injection for services
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes for different scenarios

Code Structure:
- Create the endpoint in the existing UserController
- Create any necessary services (password generation, email sending)
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add XML documentation comments for the endpoint and methods

Security Considerations:
- Ensure HTTPS is enforced for the endpoint
- Validate and sanitize the email input
- Do not log or store the generated password in plain text
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks

Sample Response:
- Success: 200 OK with a message indicating email has been sent
- Validation Error: 400 Bad Request with details
- User Not Found: 404 Not Found
- Server Error: 500 Internal Server Error with safe error message
